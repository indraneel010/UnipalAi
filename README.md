# UniPalAI 🎓🤖

UniPalAI is a dual-mode AI chatbot designed to assist students and casual users alike. Built as a web-based wrapper around LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI), it offers two distinct interaction modes:

- **UniPal**: A scholarly assistant that provides detailed, technically sound responses — like a virtual teaching assistant with a perfect GPA.
- **UniBro**: A casual, friendly chatbot with a conversational tone — like chatting with a smart, humorous friend.

> Whether you're studying for exams or just need a buddy to talk to, UniPalAI adapts to your vibe.
